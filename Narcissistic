A Narcissistic Number is a number of length n in which the sum of its digits to the power of n is equal to the original number. If this seems confusing, refer to the example below.

Ex: 153, where n = 3 (number of digits in 153)
1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3 = 153

Write a method is_narcissistic(i) (in Haskell: isNarcissistic :: Integer -> Bool) which returns whether or not i is a Narcissistic Number.


#code

def narcissistic( num ):
    power=len(str(num))
    sum=0
    temp=num
    while temp>0:
        digit = temp % 10
        sum += digit ** power
        temp //= 10
    if num == sum:
        return True
    else:
        return False
